Subject:	Weekly Progress Report “Week 3/3/18 thru 3/9/18: Capstone Project”


Accomplishments From the Week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Got Cryptol working with Z3 solver on virtual machine running Linux Ubuntu.
2. Got Cryptol working with Z3 solver on laptop with Windows operating system.
	Note: Accomplished using Gomathy's discovory.
3. Got Cryptol working with Z3 solver on PSU school servers.
	Note: Accomplished using Ryan's discovory.
4. Third meeting with Dan & Joe at Galois (March 9th, 2018).
5. Ran the AES-128.cry file test1 and test2 functions using Cryptol.
6. Tried basic functionality in Cryptol from documentation provided on Cryptol
	website.
7. Setup initial date for the final presentation.

Goals For the Coming Week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Setup doodle for Spring term availablity.
	Note: For scheduling group meeting and weekly meetings with Dr. Teuscher.
2. Understand how to read and write basic functions in Crptol.
3. Read about Haskell Curried programming
4. Get AES-128 function working
5. Write initial testbenchs for AES-128
	Note: Benchmarking for both c version & verilog version.

Issues:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Getting the binary files for Cryptol to work on PSU school servers.
	Note: Ryan figured out how to run the binary files without having to 
		  install.
2. Running cryptographic algorithm from origonal directory.
3. Setting up the PATH for Z3 solver to run on PSU school servers.
