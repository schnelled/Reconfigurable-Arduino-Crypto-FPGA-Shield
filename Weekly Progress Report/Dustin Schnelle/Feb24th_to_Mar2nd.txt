Subject:	Weekly Progress Report “Week 2/24/18 thru 3/2/18: Capstone Project”


Accomplishments From the Week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Complete intial resreach on AES-128 cryptographic algorithm.
3. Complete intial resreach on SHA-128 cryptographic algorithm.
	Note: These two algorithm's where the first two Dan & Joe told us to
		  investigate.
4. Tried to get public verison of Cryptol working (Galois GitHub).
	>Tried on PSU servers
	>Tried on laptop with Window operating system
	>Tried on virtual machine with Linux Ubuntu
5. Tried making the makefile for Z3 solver (failed).
7. Scheduled next meeting with Dan & Joe for (March 9th, 2018).

Goals For the Coming Week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Add information about choosen cyrptoalgorithms to the GitHub Wiki page.
	Note: This documentation will be used in the final project report.
2. Read more about Cryptol documentation.
	Note: Documentation for Cryptol is large (124 pages), so this is a on
		  going task.
3. Get Cryptol working on PSU school server.
4. Run the AES-128 test function in Cryptol.

Issues:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Couldn't get the public version of Cryptol working on Laptop with Window
	operating system.
2. Couldn't get the publice version of Cryptol working on PSU school servers.
	Note: Don't have the ablity to install software.
3. Couldn't get the public verison of Cryptol working on virtual machine
	running Linux Ubuntu.
4. Failed to make Z3 makefile from instructions provided by documentation.
	Note: After meeting at Galois we found out we need to use the binary file
		of Cryptol from the Galois GitHub and not the full package.
