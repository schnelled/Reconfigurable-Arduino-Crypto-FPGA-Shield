Subject:	Weekly Progress Report “Week 4/7/18 thru 4/13/18: Capstone Project”


Accomplishments From the Week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Uploaded AES128.c functionality to the Arduino Uno and preformed initial
  testing of the functionality.
2. Uploaded AES128.c functionality to the Arduino Mega for comparison.
3. Ran tests on AES128 on the Arduino Uno & Mega, Virtual Machine running
  Linux Ubuntu, and the PSU school server.
4. Added Papalio One 250K wiki page with information about the initial setup.
5. Tried uploading AES128.c to the Papalio One 250K development board.
6. Put together meeting slides for my turn to present at the weekly meeting
  with Dr. Teuscher.
7. Worked on updating the Gantt chart to show current progress

Goals For the Coming Week:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Get benchmarks and testbenches loaded onto the embedded processor and FPGA.
2. Finish updating the Gantt chart by adding allocating resources.
3. Figure out error with compiling on the ZAP IDE.
4. Gain understanding about the AES128.sv file.
5. Setup another meeting with Galois and generate important questions.

Issues:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Compiling sketches on the ZAP IDE produces an error.
