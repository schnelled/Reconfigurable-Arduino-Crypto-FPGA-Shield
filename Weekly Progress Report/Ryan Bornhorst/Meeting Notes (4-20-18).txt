Meeting Notes (4/20/18)- at Galois

Current Project Notes:

Purpose of doing the bi-simulation in Verilog
	-can grab all the factors that matter to us in single simulation
	-performance, space, correctness, area (LUTs used by FPGA)

2 items to take into account about our project
	1. FPGA will likely be faster than anything, 500 - 1000x faster
	2. Server simulations are not the best for stddev calculations
		-FPGA should have very small stddev for benchmarks

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where to go next:

SHA-256 -> located in libvcrypt
	-Galois might attempt to synthesize a SHA-2 for us in verilog
	-otherwise Joe mentioned an opensource version on "opencourse"?
		-may not be correct, needs to be tested

RNG -> uses either AES or SHA to generate random data, drbg based

Joe introduced us to Flemming, who will walk us through a rigorous AES.sv 
testbench file used for verification and speed.

Jasper is a software than runs through theorem provers.

Presentation Date -> 6/7/18  (pick time between 9am and 4pm) - ask advisor
Poster Date -> 6/8/18

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Random Notes:

FPGA should be a lot faster for small encryptions, less so for larger ones
	-due to processor caching data, locality

Can't show full verilog source code during presentation, fragments allowed.
Can say "high assurance artifacts come from Galois and were produced for 
Dept. of Defense" - something like that but not more than that

Don't use powerpoint for the poster. Joe supplied us with some examples.

crowdsupply.com -> sign up to go to teardown
	-few weeks from now
	-great learning opportunity
