Subject:	Weekly Progress Report “Week 5/04/18 thru 5/11/18: Capstone Project”

Accomplishments From the Week:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Went to Galois for demo on Cryptol and SAW 
2. Looked up how to benchmark SHA-1 using OpenSSL
3. Noticed repetitive fuction/task declarations in aes_functions
4. Noticed floorplanning and timing errors in top module

Goals For the Coming Week:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Change the FPGA in use and find a board where 384 I/O pins can be placed and routed
2. Understand how to load bitstream onto boards that do not have 384 pins
3. Load bitstream onto Mojo v3 board 

Issues/Remarks:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Contact sponsors and update them about the floorplanning errors
2. Unable to find a way to synthesize design with no constraints file
