Subject:	Weekly Progress Report “Week 3/26/18 thru 4/1/18: Capstone Project”

Accomplishments From the Week:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Tested basic programs on the Pulserain
2. Found an alternative and more effecient way to program the pulserain without the IDE.
3. Tested the bitgen in Hacrypto

Goals For the Coming Week:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a basic benchmark file looking at openssl
2. Decide how the testbench would be created for the FPGA

Issues/Remarks:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Had issues uploading benchmark file on the board since it took too much runtime memory as per memory errors displayed on compiler 
error log of Arduino IDE
